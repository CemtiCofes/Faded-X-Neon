# Rolling Sky - Faded x Neon

Faded but using Neon themes and objects. Some Faded objects are still used in the level, though. Some additional objects from Ignite, Egypt, Deep space, and Street Basketball are also used in the level.

The level files work best on Rolling Sky PC.

To play the level, I recommend using Rolling Sky Unlocked:

  - To Install Rolling Sky Unlocked for PC, simply download the Assembly-CSharp.dll from the Drive folder and put it on Rolling Sky_Data/Managed
  - Launch the game. Then go to the Rolling Sky folder. There you will see folder named Buckets.
  - Go to Buckets and copy all the files above to the correct folder
    - For Level48, put it on Levels
    - For Theme48, put it on Themes
    - For geoBuffer48, put it on GeoBuffers
  - Re-launch the game and you will have Faded x Neon in your Rolling Sky!
